# RMI-Following-2019

Following is the competition conducted by RMI, the robotics research and development club of NITT. I participate in it and was placed 3rd overall. The problem statement expects us to make a line following bot with an algorithm which can move to a particular coordinate in the line grid and come back to the initial point. the second task includes Image processing, recognizing shapes and decoding to their prefixed coordinates and moving to those coordinates and coming back to the initial point.
