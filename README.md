I participated in the RMI-Following-2019 competition organized by the Robotics Research and Development Club of NITT and secured 3rd place overall. The competition required participants to design and develop a line following bot with an algorithm that could navigate to a specific coordinate on the line grid and return to the starting point. The second task involved image processing, shape recognition, and decoding to predetermined coordinates, followed by movement to these coordinates and back to the starting point.

In this repository, you will find my solution to the RMI-Following-2019 competition. I have included the code, documentation, and other necessary files to help anyone interested in understanding and replicating my approach to the problem statement.

Thank you for visiting my repository and please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or feedback!
